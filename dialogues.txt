Hello, I am Hachiko, the head butler to his majesty king George III. You must be the king's new attendant. 
As most people would be, Hachiko's mood seems to be better after agreeing with him.
Alright, now you may head into the changeroom to your right and change into one of the uniforms there. Then you must head to his majesty's bedchamber and wake him.
So, you have entered his majesty's chambers. He must be woken. How will you go about this?
You start to sing an old folk song your mother taught you. The sleeping king soon wakes up.
Your voice is very agreeable. Go to the throne room and wait for me there. 
WHAT IS THAT HORRID SCREECHING! Ah I see it is you. Hasn't anyone told you how horrid your voice is? Go to the throne room and wait for me there.
You walk up to the sleeping king and tap his shoulder lightly once. The sleeping king soon wakes up.
HOW DARE YOU TOUCH ME! YOUR LOWLY HANDS ARE NOT EVEN QUALIFIED TO TOUCH MY FEET! GO TO THE THRONE ROOM AND WAIT FOR ME THERE!
You decide to ignore the sleeping king and instead start cleaning his disorderly chambers. A maid enters the room with an aromatic breakfast tray. The aroma wakes the sleeping king.
How lovely it is to wake up to food! You there, good job cleaning! Go to the throne room and wait for me there.
How lovely it is to wake up to food! However, you there, HOW DARE YOU TOUCH MY POSSESSIONS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION! Go to the throne room and wait for me there.
As you walk through the halls, you notice a Hachiko on the ground surrounded by scattered papers. He seems to have fallen. What will you do?
You stop and help Hachiko gather the papers. You then ask him where they need to be.
Ah, thank you, these need to be brought to his majesty's study. As thanks, would you like to hear a story?
As you walk past Hachiko, he seems to force a smile.
Ah, young people these days are still willing to listen to old dogs like me.
I guess young people these days don't have the time to listen to old dogs like me.
HOW DARE YOU BE LATE AND MAKE ME WAIT FOR YOU! Anyway, your job is to pick the petitions I will be looking at today.
Alright, your job is to pick the petitions I will be looking at today.

Ah, what a good dog Reginald is! Inform him I will be there.
Oooh, I haven't talked to mother dearest in so long. Set an appointment tomorrow for tea.

Ugh, again, deploy the guards I guess.
Ah these commoners know nothing. Last time t'was a werewolf, now a witch. Let them deal with it on their own for once.
ASKING FOR LOWER TAXES AGAIN!! NO WAY! TAXES ARE LOW ENOUGH, IN FACT LET'S INCREASE TAXES!
WONDERFUL!! Barnaby never disappoints!!
His majesty is fickle and isn't very pleasant to be around as you are likely to be prosecuted should you make a wrong choice. Whichever describes the king best is what he will like best.
