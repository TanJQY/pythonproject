Hello, I am Hachiko, the head butler to his majesty king George III. You must be the king's new attendant. 
As most people would be, Hachiko's mood seems to be better after agreeing with him.
Alright, now you may head into the changeroom to your right and change into one of the uniforms there. Then you must head to his majesty's bedchamber and wake him.
So, you have entered his majesty's chambers. He must be woken. How will you go about this?
You start to sing an old folk song your mother taught you. The sleeping king soon wakes up.
Your voice is very agreeable. 
WHAT IS THAT HORRID SCREECHING! Ah I see it is you. Hasn't anyone told you how horrid your voice is?
You walk up to the sleeping king and tap his shoulder lightly once. The sleeping king soon wakes up.
HOW DARE YOU TOUCH ME! YOUR LOWLY HANDS ARE NOT EVEN QUALIFIED TO TOUCH MY FEET!
You decide to ignore the sleeping king and instead start cleaning his disorderly chambers. A maid enters the room with an aromatic breakfast tray. The aroma wakes the sleeping king.
How lovely it is to wake up to food! You there, good job cleaning!
How lovely it is to wake up to food! However, you there, HOW DARE YOU TOUCH MY POSSESSIONS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!
