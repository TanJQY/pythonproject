Describe what you plan to do under each option in the Main Menu


Option 1 -- Interactive Game
* If this option is chosen, an interactive game will start. Throughout the entirety of the game there will also be a back button in the top left corner for the user to press to return to the main menu. This game is set in a medieval fantasy world where dogs have gained sentience and have taken over the world. The user will roleplay as a new human attendant to the temperamental Shiba Inu King. The game will go through one day of the user serving the king. The user will have to make appropriate choices to increase their goodwill meter. Luck will also play a part in the user’s ability to increase their goodwill meter. At the end of the day, the user’s fate will be decided by how high their goodwill meter is. Each subsequent part is separated by a choice that the user must make. The game will begin with instructions displayed to the user on how to play.


* Instructions
   * In this game, you will roleplay as the new attendant to the king. Throughout this game, you will be offered choices. When a choice is presented to you, hover your mouse over the desired option and left click once to select it. Your goal is to increase your goodwill meter as much as possible through appropriate choices to avoid execution. If at anytime you wish to go back to the main menu, you may click the back button in the left hand corner, however your progress will not be saved.


* Prologue:
   * It all started when the Shiba Inus gained enough intelligence to be on par with humans. They were dissatisfied with their position as pets, as such they led other dogs to reach the same state as them and started a great war. The dogs won and the leader of the rebellion, a Shiba Inu, was crowned king.


* Part 1
   * The user is standing in a grand hallway. In this hallway there is a group of human servants whispering and pointing at them. Someone goes up to the group and tells them to get back to work. This someone then approaches the user and introduces themself as Hachiko the head butler. Hachiko then asks the user whether they are the new attendant. The user will be presented with 2 choices: “I think you have the wrong person” (choice 1) or “Yes, I am”  (choice 2). Choice 1 will lead to ending 1 while choice 2 will lead to the user successfully moving on to part 2.


* Part 2
   * As most people would be, Hachiko’s mood seems to be slightly better after the user agreed with him. Goodwill meter randomly goes up by 1% - 5%. Hachiko then instructs the user to go change into a uniform then head to the King’s bedchamber to wake him up. Before Hachiko leaves, he also warns the user of the king’s temperamental nature. The user is then presented with a choice between escaping (choice 1) and following Hachiko’s instructions (choice 2). Depending on what the user chooses, they will progress to a different section of part 3.


* Part 3 a)
   * Part 3 a) occurs if the user chooses choice 1. A random integer from 1 - 100 is generated. If the number is 100, user progresses to ending 2, else the user progresses to ending 3.
* Part 3 b)
   * Part 3 b) occurs if the user chooses choice 2. The user is presented with 2 cards, each with a different uniform design on them. User’s choice will not have any effect on the game. Both choices lead to part 4.


* Part 4
   * User enters the king’s bedchamber and must now wake the sleeping king. The user is presented with 3 choices: “sing a song” (choice 1), “tap his shoulder gently” (choice 2), “ignore him” (choice 3). Depending on which choice is selected the user will progress to a different section of part 5.


* Part 5 a)
   * Part 5 a) occurs if the user selected choice 1. A random integer from 1 - 100 is generated. If the number is between 1 - 15, the king wakes up and finds your voice lovely, goodwill meter increases randomly by 5%-15% and the user moves on to part 6. However if any other number is generated the king wakes up and finds your voice to be atrocious, goodwill meter decreases randomly from 5%-15% and the user moves on to part 6.


* Part 5 b)
   * Part 5 b) occurs if the user selected choice 2. Although the user tapped the king gently, when he wakes up he is enraged that you dared to touch him at all. Goodwill meter drops randomly from 15%-30%. User moves on to part 6


* Part 5 c)
   * Part 5 c) occurs if the user selected choice 3. The user decides to ignore the sleeping king and instead focuses on tidying the chamber. While the user cleans, a maid comes in with a tray of breakfast for the king. The aroma wakes the king. An integer between 1 and 100 is generated. If the integer is between 1 and 35, the king is satisfied waking up to a nice breakfast and a clean room and goodwill meter increases randomly by 8% - 20%. If not, the king is angry that you touched his possessions without his permission and goodwill meter decreases randomly by 8%-20%. User then moves on to part 6


* Part 6
   * The king then orders the user to go to the throne room and wait for him there.As the user walks through the halls, they see a fallen Hachiko picking up many scattered papers. The user must now pick between stopping to help (choice 1) or to keep going (choice 2). Depending on which option is chosen, the user will progress to a different section in part 7 and will affect what happens in part 9.
